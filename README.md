This is the code that was used for our approach on predicting judgments (whether a person or a group agrees or disagrees) with an assertion.

For the machine learning approaches we rely on the machine learning framework DKPro TC (https://dkpro.github.io/dkpro-tc/), so the code is mostly written in java (except for the tensorflow experiments, that are written in python).
The project uses Java 1.8. You need to set a DKPRO_HOME variable as described here https://zoidberg.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/jenkins/job/DKPro%20TC%20Documentation%20(GitHub)/org.dkpro.tc%24dkpro-tc-doc/doclinks/1/#QuickStart
