This is the code that was used for our approach on predicting judgments (whether a person or a group agrees or disagrees) with an assertion.

For the machine learning approaches we rely on the machine learning framework DKPro TC (https://dkpro.github.io/dkpro-tc/), so the code is mostly written in java (except for the tensorflow experiments, that are written in python).
